# EvilHangman
A project for C S 240 which is now a web based class so I think I can make this public. A console program that plays a game of hangman with the user which dynamically picks words based on the user's input. It keeps changing to whatever is the biggest group while still keeping the same revealed letters, and picks a random one when the user fails.
