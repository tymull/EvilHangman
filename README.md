# EvilHangman
A project for C S 240 which is now a web based class so I think I can make this public. A console program that plays a game of hangman with the user which dynamically picks words based on the user's input. It keeps changing to whatever is the biggest group while still keeping the same revealed letters, and picks a random one when the user fails.


I wrote this program several times to prepare for a test where we would have to write one of a set of projects within 3hrs in a proctored room with no outside resources except for java documentation. This was the project I received for the test, so I included my implementation I did for the test, which I think might be cleaner than than the other.
